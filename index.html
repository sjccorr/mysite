    <h3>Indroduction:</h3>
    <p class="alignleft">
     Welcome! I am an IT Support Technicain employed at Amazon. 
     I have been empolyed at Amazon for 9 years but have been a Technician 
     for less than 3. Mostly I deal with printer and laptop issues
     but learn something new almost every day. Most of important of these
     is not to assume anything and to start with the basics. The seemingly
     same problem does not always have the same solution and more
     once, I have spent hours trying to fix something, just to find
     that simply power cycling(turning it off/on) a device will solve
     the issue at hand(especially printers!)

      <h3>Trying Something New</h3>
      <p class="alignleft">IT Technicians mostly deal with the hardware(physical) side
         of things but without the code(and power) to tell the device what to do,
         an IT device is just a paper weight. I have started a journey
         to see how devices work 'under the hood' so to speak. This is
         my first step to jouney to achieve that goal. So far, have
         learned to put together a very basic web page and am looking
         forward to where this journey will ultimately take me.
